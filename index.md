Feature model analysis tools require to have enough data for testing and checking purposes, and as a solution, researchers proposed \fms generation and extraction from multiple sources. Also, different tools take as input different file formats. To solve this issue and avoid the generation of new feature models for an analysis tool, this site presents a dataset of a variety of feature models, including  ones adapted from existing source tools and others generated by the Betty tool, all the resulting feature models in the formats for the FaMa and S.P.L.O.T. tools, as well as in the open-source graphic tool GraphViz format.

In addition, mainly looking for a feature models variety for testing purposes, this dataset also includes a variety of the existing feature models as the result of applying a tool to add a defined number of changes and inconsistencies in feature models which are saved in the mentioned files format. Thus, dataset files will be able for download, for their use in FaMa, S.P.L.O.T., and GraphViz tools, or for their adaptation and use with other analysis tools.
